<div class="title"><h1>The Rabbit and the Apple</h1>A vivid lesson for students.</div>
<div class="article">
<!-- Copyright 2000 Buzzle.com -->
Once upon a time, near an ancient castle in southern Germany, an apple
fell from a tree. The apple grew up attached to a branch, that was
attached to a limb, that was attached to the trunk of this short and
strong apple tree. The tree took care of the apple all summer. The tree
protected the apple, held onto it during the stormy winds,and fed the
apple with nutrients from the ground, air, and sky. The tree also kept
the apple out of the reach of a hungry rabbit, who frequently looked up
at the apple with longing little black bunny eyes. Day after day the
bunny hoped that the tree would finally let him have the apple, so he
could take it home and show his bunny wife, who would bake a pie out of
it and make all his little bunny children happy. <br>
<br>
On the day the apple fell, the bunny was hanging out near the local
stream, talking to some butterflies and making jokes about the tadpoles
(of course only behind mother frog's back) He asked the butterflies
simple questions because he knew they were only insects and by their
nature, were not very smart. They knew few words in the bunny language,
but it was enough to trade information about where the juiciest clovers
were, and whether or not they thought it would storm that evening.
Suddenly, the bunny heard a thud. It was no doubt made by the apple
when it hit the soft grass near the trunk of the tree. His big white
bunny ears flung backward instantly so he could hear better. With a few
wiggles of his pink bunny nose, he knew the apple had finally come down
for him. <br>
<br>
His wet nose smelled the delicious sugary aroma of the apple, and he
could almost taste a slice of his bunny wife's delicious apple pie.
Hippity-hoppety-hippity-hoppety. The bunny bounced and jumped with
excitement over to his lookout rock, on the bank of the stream. He
wanted to see the apple with his own black bunny eyes. As he reached
the top, he saw for 200 feet in every direction. This is a lot,
considering bunnies mainly live on the ground. Anyway. He saw the apple
and was filled with more excitement than a 5 year old on Christmas
morning. Truly, it was like Christmas for his baby bunnies back home.<br>
<br>
To his most jarring surprise, he saw one of the farmers cows lumbering
around, munching on grass and weeds. The bunny knew that the cow was
far too stupid to link the sound of the thud to the falling of the
apple, but he also knew that cows have extremely big heads with
extremely big noses (and extremely small brains to run it all). The
bunny took out his bunny-size spectacles because, like many bunnies in
southern Germany, he had genetically inherited short-sightedness. Much
to his shagrin, he arranged his glasses just in time to see the
egg-size nostril holes on the end of the cow's snout flare to twice
their normal size. As he glanced up the cows long face, he saw the cows
eyes enlarge to the size of peaches. With his long floppy ears, he
heard a low grunt of excitement. The cow knew what had happened and
where. <br>
<br>
Like the bunny, the cow also had invested much time day dreaming about
smashing the fat red apple between her long rows of bumpy molars. Her
enormous tongue would be covered with red apple peel, and moist sweet
flavorings harvested from the summer's warm sunshine and gentle added
by the tree among its plant fibers. The cow moved with new found
urgency toward where the apple had fallen. Driven by desire for the
novel flavors offered by the apple. Quite alarmed, and very distraught
over the prospect of seeing his little baby bunnies go without their
Christmas apple, and most of all - coming home to a disappointed wife
(if you know anything about the habits of bunnies, you will know why a
mad Mrs. Bunny is very troubling to Mr. Bunny) the bunny's face dropped
into all-business mode. <br>
<br>
No more cute nose wiggles. His long black whiskers snapped back against
his cheeks, forced to fur-level as the wind pushed against his conical
head. His head jogged up and down in perfect rhythm with his powerful
hind legs. He used to be a track runner in his bunny high school days.
He was so fast in those days, he bragged he could out run the birds.
The cows hooves sank into the mud near the stream, but she was also
closer to the tree. Slowed by the mud, and generally tired from all
this exertion, the cow seemed as if she would not be able to fulfill
her succulent dreams. Never the less, she plugged on. Her udders swung
between her legs like a giant metronome keeping time with a somewhat
lively jazz song.<br>
<br>
Mr. bunny saw how quick he got a lead on the bovine tractor-trailer. He stopped to smoke a cigarette.<br>
<br>
As the bunny was about mid-way through with his fine turkish blend, the
cow had disappeared behind a rolling hedgerow. The bunny looked up and
realized that the cow had somehow disappeared. He looked over to the
apple, laying on the ground - no cow in sight. He decided he'd have
enough time to finish a couple more puffs and then jog over and pick up
nature's prize. But just as he reached the apple, a huge mass of black
and white swung down past his little paws and swiped the apple right
from under his nose. The bunny was congratulated for his effort with a
splatter of apple juice and shards of apple skin. He sat stunned, with
juice dripping off his face. The cow gave the apple two or three chews
and swallowed it for safe keeping. Later she'd chew on it a little more
just to soften up the seeds.<br>
<br>
When Mr. bunny returned home, he did not have the heart to tell his
family about what his over confidence had cost all of them. He figured,
they never knew about his planned surprise, so he would not need to
bring up what had happened. For days he dwelled heavily on how stupid
he had been to take a break, and what the cost of happiness had been. A
simple pleasure, a short pause, with the goal in sight. Now his family
had been let down and only he knew it. The bunny learned that if he was
to make big plans involving the hopes and dreams of others, he could
never take time for himself if they were to become real.<br>
